## Procedure to run the simulator's 6 steps:
1)	Introduction
*	Select the application.
*	Read the theory and start the test.
*	Attempt all the questions from the test and submit the test.
*	Click Next level.

2)	Configuration
*	Select I/p converter type and do necessary calculation to configure it.
*	After Successful configuration click Next Level.

3)	Connection
*	According to selected I/p converter type, Select the require components from symbol library to do the connections.
*	Click check connection button.
*	After successful connection click Next Level button.

4)	Characterization
*	Take multiple readings to check output of I/p converter.
*	Plot the graph for the same readings.
*	Click Next Level

5)	Calibration
*	Calculate zero error, span error, linearity and Average Percentage Accuracy.
*	Calibrate the I/p converter.
*	Remove zero error
*	Remove span error.
*	Try to get the linearity.
*	Click Next Level 

6)	Fault Detection
*	Detect the 3 faults for the I/p converter’s  few reading.
